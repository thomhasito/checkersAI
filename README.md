## Installation

To install the project, simply clone the repository to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomhasito/checkersAI.git
```

## Description

This project is a Python implementation of the classic game of Checkers (Draughts). Challenge yourself to play and defeat the AI opponent. The AI is powered by the MinMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Game Rules

The game follows the standard rules of Checkers. You can find the complete rules on this website: [http://www.ffjd.fr/Web/index.php?page=reglesdujeu](http://www.ffjd.fr/Web/index.php?page=reglesdujeu)

## Usage

This project is designed to run with Python 3.8 or later. To play the game, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
